# DeviantArt Link Fixer

## What is this Project for?
----
With this Script you can open all link like a half year before.

The last month the DeviantArt Team goes on more aggressive with the Eclipse-Project. In that way they even start to break the old Version without repair stuff.

Lately the even broke a couple of links, which can now only opened with a little workaround (open in new tab), which is annoying. This script fixes ALL links on the page and removes junk from them, such as:

- Google-Analytic values
- Ping-Attribute
- Other values which cause the link to be stuck _(most of them are only for track users anyway, so we dont need them)_
- The target value (Often used for open in new tab)


Often these Links are affected (broken) by the changes of the WIX-Team:

- Download-"Buttons"
- View-Gallery Links
- Username Links
